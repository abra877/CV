            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>My name is David Ghantt. I am an actor from Shawnee, Oklahoma, though I now live in Los Angeles like
                every other actor. I have a wide range of acting skills, from action and thriller to comedy and drama.

                I am known for playing charismatic male leads, and have been described as the world's most attractive
                man by several media outlets. Nowadays I prefer subtler roles, including those where I play a father
                figure, which I am to my six
                children.

                Apart from acting, I have experience as a producer for many films with my own production company Plan B
                Entertainment, of which I am the CEO.
                In my spare time, I enjoy philanthropy, architecture, and skateboarding.
            </p>
